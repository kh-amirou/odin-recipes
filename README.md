The current project is making a recipe website. 

Once I've finished making this website, the following skills that I will have demonstrated are the following:
1. Creating a homepage with HTML, including the usage of HTML tags such as "<em>, <strong>, <ol>, <ul>, <a>, <img>, <p>".
2. Creating multiple recipe pages with a similar structure as [1].
3. Creating a file structure that is appropriate to the best web development practices.
