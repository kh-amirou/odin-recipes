    <p>The nectar of the gods: Chocolate. Asgardians would attest to how wars have fought for them, and celebrated with them.</p>

    <p>And as this temptress found its match in a pie crust - perhaps the only thing that could contain its raw sensuality, so shall you lure the resident of Valhalla to accept you as one of their own.</p>

        <li>1 (5 ounce) package non-instant chocolate pudding mix</li>
        <li>2 cups low-fat milk</li>
        <li>(8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup chocolate shavings</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Make:</h2>
    <ol>
